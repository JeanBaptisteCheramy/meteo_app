# meteo_app

This is my second Flutter project, a simple meteo app. The goal is to build a project with forms, API calls and discover the Riverpod framework for state management.
I am self-learning by conducting research on the internet. I work using the documentation and all possible resources to enhance my skills on a daily basis.

It's a work in progress.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
